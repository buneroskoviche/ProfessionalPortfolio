                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Daniel Kinser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am employed full-time performing data entry at an education company. The company goal is to inspire confidence in others by teaching leadership and public speaking skills.
                    I have developed many of these skills in this role as well as knowledge of software systems, customer service and team communication.
                    I am confident that I am a strong asset to my team, but I feel that I have reached the limits of the position and I am ready to move on to the next step up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always had an affinity for entertainment and media so I pursued a creative career in my early adult life.
                    After four years of college, I received my Bachelor's degree in Media Arts with a specialization in 3D Animation. 
                    During the course I gained deep knowledge and immense appreciation for the arts, but felt that I had a stronger aptitude for the technical side of the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While playing with PC games, I discovered a community dedicated to modifying game code to create custom content.
                    The concept of organizing simple letters and numbers into something exiciting and interactive was intriguing.
                    It seemed that coding would allow me to be creative in a way that played to my innate strengths.
                    This could be the step up that I have been looking for!
                </p>
