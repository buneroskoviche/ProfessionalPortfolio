                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Daniel Kinser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently I am employed full-time performing data entry at an education company. The company goal is to inspire confidence in others by teaching leadership and public speaking skills.
                        I have developed many of these skills in this role as well as knowledge of software systems, customer service and team communication.
                        I am confident that I am a strong asset to my team, but I feel that I have reached the limits of the position and I am ready to move on to the next step up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have always had an affinity for entertainment and media so I pursued a creative career in my early adult life.
                        After four years of college, I received my Bachelor's degree in Media Arts with a specialization in 3D Animation. 
                        During the course I gained deep knowledge and immense appreciation for the arts, but felt that I had a stronger aptitude for the technical side of the work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of organizing simple letters and numbers into something exiciting and interactive was intriguing.
                        It seemed that coding would allow me to be creative in a way that played to my innate strengths.
                        Coding could be the step up that I have been looking for!
